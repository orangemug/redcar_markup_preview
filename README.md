# Redcar Markup Preview
Redcar plugin to render files with Markdown, Textile or RDoc (more markup formats coming soon!),
so I (and others) don't have to keep checking in incorrect versions of the README on github! See
more [here](http://orangemug.github.com/redcar_markup_preview).

## Usage

### By choice:

1. Open a file with supported markup
2. Press Ctrl+Shift+M
3. Choose the markup language
4. Press Enter and enjoy!

### Auto (worked out from the file extension):

1. Open a file with supported markup
2. Press Ctrl+Shift+P
4. Enjoy beautifully rendered markup


## Supported formats:

 * [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)
 * [Textile](http://textile.thresholdstate.com/)
 * [RDoc](http://rdoc.sourceforge.net/doc/)
